Moblin - IRL Streaming
======================

A free iOS app for IRL streaming. Mainly targeting `Twitch`_, but can
stream to `YouTube`_, `Kick`_, `Facebook`_ and `OBS Studio`_ as well
(and probably more).

Not yet in App Store, but on `TestFlight`_!

Ideas/plan
==========

- Show two cameras at the same time.

- Use lossy video format? More effecient?

- Always receive sampels from all mics for smoother transition between mics?

- Button to show black screen.

- Reduce brightness when thermal state is critical.
  
- Optionally disable wide angle lens (use dual camera).
  
- A list of usernames whos messages will not get displayed on screen.

- Rework zoom. Fine tune similar to builtin camera app.

- Audio filters. For example volume limiter.

  - An adjustable gain would be nice, then limiter (to keep audio from
    clipping), and a noise gate would be my top 3 requested audio
    filters when you have the time. I think that would be the same
    order in terms of complexity to implement as well.

- Button to turn maximum screen FPS on and off. Or possibly "low
  power" mode?

- Use external UVC camera. Looks like iOS 17 supports them.

- Use multiple mics at the same time?

- Reintroduce settings in portrait.

- Take picture.

- OPUS audio codec? https://github.com/alta/swift-opus

- Optionally do not automatically start using external mic is plugged
  in.

- Advanced settings toggle.

- Non-mirrored widgets locally when using front camera.

- Add Twitch/Kick Icons next to chat messages depending on which
  platform the message came from.

- Toggles to enable/disable "Go live" and "Stop" confirmations. Per
  stream?

- RTMP server for external video and audio?

- Multiple Ethernet connections simultaneously?

- Automatically go live when starting app, if configured for selected
  stream setting. Probably a good idea to go live again when entering
  foregound if was live when entering background

- Lookup Twitch channel id from channel name. Possibly login to
  Twitch.

- Play music and short sound samples.

- Record to disk.

- Something that is important for professional streamers: Ad
  management. There are new endpoints to get and snooze the next ad
  schedule. No app uses it afaik yet.

Import settings using moblin:// (custom URL)
============================================

An example creating a new stream is

.. code-block::

   moblin://?{"streams":[{"name":"BELABOX%20UK","url":"srtla://uk.srt.belabox.net:5000?streamid=9812098rh9hf8942hid","video":{"codec":"H.265/HEVC"}}]}

where the URL decoded pretty printed JSON blob is

.. code-block:: json

   {
     "streams": [
       {
         "name": "BELABOX UK",
         "url": "srtla://uk.srt.belabox.net:5000?streamid=9812098rh9hf8942hid",
         "video": {
           "codec": "H.265/HEVC"
         }
       }
     ]
   }

Format: ``moblin://?<URL encoded JSON blob>``

The ``MoblinSettingsUrl`` class in `MoblinSettingsUrl.swift`_ defines
the JSON blob format. Class members are JSON object keys. Members with
``?`` after the type are optional. Some types are defined in
`Settings.swift`_.

Clock
^^^^^

Configured text:

.. code-block:: text

   {clock}
